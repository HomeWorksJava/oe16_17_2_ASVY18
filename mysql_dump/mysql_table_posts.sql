According to a report Monday by the Economic Times, Apple may also sell locally sourced accessories via its online store.\n\nHowever, the report states that the iPhone maker won’t compete on price with online marketplaces for the items carried via its Indian online store. About half the iPhone models the Cupertino firm sells in the country are purchased online.\n\nApple reportedly plans to differentiate its online store from marketplaces like Amazon and Flipkart by offering value-added services, such as laser engraving, to personalize the handset. It may also sell models or variants which are exclusive such as a dedicated model, colour option or storage space, source said.\n\n“The product portfolio will be expanded as Apple grows the local production to other models,” reads the report.\n\nTwo senior industry officials said the online store won’t require foreign direct investment approval in retail like physical stores do. That’s because the Indian government now allows companies to directly sell items online as long as they’re manufactured locally.\n\nAnother source said Indian online store should come online around Diwali, an official holiday in India and a few other countries that runs in the middle of October. Apple supplier Wistron plans to start assembling of iPhones in Bengaluru by June.\n\nNews18.com disagrees, however, cautioning that the store relies on a lot of “ifs and buts.”\n\nAccording to that publication, there are two reasons as to why the story may not be entirely accurate. “First, Apple iPhone SE was met with lukewarm response in India and it is not Apple’s latest offering. Second, why would Apple launch an online store to just sell one product?”, as per News18.com.\n\nAs for the physical stores, Apple could open up to five flagship outlets in India over the next five to ten years, with first offline outlets set to initially open in the metroes.\n\nApple Online Store currently operates in 39 countries.\n\nSource: Economic Times of India', '2017-05-01 18:40:24');

KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo estimated in a note to clients Monday that the rumored Siri-based smart speaker has “over 50 percent chance” of making its WWDC debut.\n\nHere’s an excerpt from the note, obtained by MacRumors:\n\nWe believe there is an over 50 percent chance that Apple will announce its first home AI product at WWDC in June and start selling in the second half of 2017 in order to compete with the new Amazon Echo models to be launched in the second half of this year.\nKuo expects the device to have “excellent acoustics performance” with a subwoofer and seven tweeters. In terms of CPU, it should be comparable to iPhone 6 or iPhone 6s, suggesting a variant of Apple’s in-house designed A8 or the A9 chip.\n\nWe expect Apple’s first home AI product will have excellent acoustics performance (one woofer and seven tweeters) and computing power similar to iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s application processor.\nAs previously reported, the gizmo should use Beats audio technology and run a variant of iOS.\n\nThe device will go head-on against similar AI-driven smart speakers, namely Google Home and Amazon’s range of Echo devices: the standard $180 Echo, the inexpensive $50 Echo Dot and the new $200 hands-free Echo Look camera for wannabe fashionistas.', '2017-05-01 18:43:29');

BuzzFeed News was first to report on Twitter’s plans to host continuous video feed on its platform.\n\nTwitter for iOS is a free download via App Store.\n\nSource: The Wall Street Journal', '2017-05-01 18:48:17');
